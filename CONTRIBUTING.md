# Become a MonkeyZone Contributor
Let's build a game

## Communication
* Create a new thread under the [MonkeyZone Topic](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/c/user-code-projects/monkeyzone) in the [jMonkeyEngine Community](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org).
  * Do you best to explain your contribution.
  * Include images, code-snippets, videos to show your change in action.
* Create a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
  * Do not commit your code until you have received proper feedback.
  * In your commit log, please refer back to the community thread.
  * When committing, always be sure to run an update before you commit.
* Update the Wiki

## Best Practices
### General
* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask when in doubt.
* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* Exceptions should be exceptional.
* Keep the code simple.
### Object-Oriented Design
* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
